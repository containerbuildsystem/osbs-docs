OpenShift Build Service
=======================


OSBS is a collection of tools, workflows and integration points that build and release layered container images.

OSBS hooks into Koji_ with the help of the koji-containerbuild plugin, and
uses `OpenShift builds <https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/builds.html>`_ as Content Generators to produce layered images.

.. _Koji: https://pagure.io/koji

One can start an image build with ``fedpkg``, using the ``container-build``
subcommand:

.. code::

    $ fedpkg container-build
